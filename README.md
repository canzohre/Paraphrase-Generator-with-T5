      Creating A Paraphrase Generator using T-5  deep  learning model   

In this study, a model that returns the paraphrase of the entered sentence was developed using SNLI, MSRPC and Tapaco datasets and the T-5 deep learning model. Although the results are not ideal because the datasets are not fully suitable both in terms of context and size, very good results can be achieved if appropriate data is obtained and used.

It is possible to create datasets for such applications with great efforts through using  sentence transformer models and various web-scraping methods.I am planing to work for create such a dataset soon and try this model with that dataset.


Note: It is necessary to make additional efforts to make the Tapaco dataset suitable for this task. I did not share that part.
